## Leaflet.TimeDimension.Rainviewer

Add Rain Radar and Satellite Images from [RainViewer](https://www.rainviewer.com/) to a [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) Map using [Leaflet TimeDimension](https://github.com/socib/Leaflet.TimeDimension).

The implementation is largely based on the [Leaflet TimeDimension Portus Example](https://github.com/socib/Leaflet.TimeDimension/blob/master/examples/js/extras/leaflet.timedimension.tilelayer.portus.js).

> [!Warning]
> Rain Viewer is no longer providing weather tiles below zoom level 7 and introduced a rate limit of 100 requests/IP/minute. See <https://www.rainviewer.com/api/transition-faq.html>
